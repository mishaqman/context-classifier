This application will enable a user to train a context classifier by providing about a hundred sentences per context and then use that classifier to predict a classification for a given document text.

It also identifies different types of phrases present in a sentence, namely named entity, noun phrase or a money/number/percent.

Also, it helps the users to perform a cognitive search on hundreds of documents to get the results in seconds.
